An MVC framework for JavaScript browser applications. The real MVC. The Smalltalk MVC. The Gang of Four MVC. 

* A model contains domain data. When a model changes, it informs its observers.

* A view observes a model. A view represents its model's current state. Views can have child views.

* A controller decides what happens when a user interacts with its view. This is the strategy pattern.

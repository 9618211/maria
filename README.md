Maria
=====

An MVC framework for JavaScript browser applications. The real MVC. The Smalltalk MVC. The Gang of Four MVC. 

* A model contains domain data. When a model changes, it informs its observers.

* A view observes a model and represents its model's current state. Views can have child views. Views have a controller.

* A controller decides what happens when a user interacts with its view.

The observer pattern, composite pattern, and strategy pattern are embedded in Maria's Model, View, and Controller objects.

Thanks to [James Ladd](http://jamesladdcode.com/) for encouraging me to start this project. Checkout his [Redline Smalltalk](http://www.redline.st/) if Smalltalk on the JVM seems like a good idea to you.
